# recon
A workaround that provides qualified expressions (aka record constructors) in Oracle versions &lt;18c.

This is an early working prototype. One should expect breaking changes to be introduced. I don't recommend using it in production environments.

## TODO:

* extract code that builds functions into separate, deterministic functions;
* move types to separate package;
* add table comments;
* create tutorial;
* create user guide;
* associative arrays;
